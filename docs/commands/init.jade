    The `init` command loads Zulu into the environment. Should be called in `~/.zshrc` to launch Zulu on shell startup.

    ## Usage

    ```
    zulu init [options]
    ```

    ## Options

    ### `-c`, `--check-for-update`

    Specifying the `--check-for-update` option will check for updates to Zulu, the index and any installed packages, and prompt the user to run the `self-update`, `update` or `upgrade` commands as appropriate.

    ### `--no-compile`

    Skips background compilation of Zulu, packages and user scripts when loading Zulu.

    ### `--next`

    Checks out the `next` branch of Zulu, allowing you to test new features before they make it into the main release.

    ### `--dev`

    Useful for Zulu developers. When enabled, Zulu will load the source for a command when it is executed, preventing the need to rebuild Zulu and reload the environment between changes.

    ### `--bare`

    Launches Zulu without loading any installed packages, user-defined aliases, functions or variables. Useful for package developers to rule out any environment issues when debugging.
