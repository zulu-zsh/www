    Zulu provides 4 commands to help you manage the different path arrays available to you in ZSH. They are `zulu path`, `zulu fpath`, `zulu cdpath` and `zulu manpath`. Since they all work the same way, we'll concentrate on the path command here.

    ### Adding a directory to `$path`

    First, let's create a simple executable script, and then add its directory to `$path`, so we can call it like a normal command.

    ```sh
    mkdir scripts
    echo "echo 'It works!'" > scripts/my_test_script
    chmod u+x scripts/my_test_script
    ```

    If you run `my_test_script` now, you should see a `command not found` error in your terminal. To let the shell find it, we need to add the scripts directory to the `$path` array.

    ```sh
    zulu path add scripts
    ```

    Now, try running `my_test_script` again. You'll see `It works!` appear in the terminal. Let's remove the test directory we just created, and remove it from `$path` again.

    ```sh
    zulu path rm scripts
    rm -rf scripts
    ```

    The `path` command works with absolute paths as well.

    ```sh
    zulu path add /usr/local/bin
    ```
